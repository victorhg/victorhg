## üöÄ About me

I'm a Masters Student in Artificial Intelligence at University of San Diego. I also define myself as a Husband, Entrepreneur, Computer Scientist, specialist in marketing. I'm a Brazilian living in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. 

In 2010, I helped found Lambda3, a software consulting company in Brazil specialized in Digital Products and Data Science, acting as CEO until 2024, when I steped down to pursue other objectives. The company was acquired in 2021 by the Tivit Group. I'm passionate about Digital Strategy and Innovation through Technology.

I have worked in many roles within the software industry. I've delivered code in production as a Software Developer, worked as a Release Engineer helping create the whole Delivery pipeline that now is known as DevOps. As an Agile Coach, I helped teams and companies take advantage of Agile processes and values to better deliver products. I also worked in the frontline of selling Agile Projects, which has gave me a lot of insights on how to build contracts that do not fall on the fixed scope trap. In my latest position, I helped lead a company with 180 professionals in software development, and also advising organizations about technology and innovation. 

At the moment I'm pursuing a technical masters while still mentoring entrepreneurs as they create new startups.
